This will be a visual where am I in the maze of the design<br>
this will be the map view to manage the complexity<br>
of the program (system) and subsystems.<br>

<br>
This will be to track where I am at any moment inside the <br>
labyrinth of the system.<br><br>
there will be levels 
<br><br>
and it will show me where I am working on currently.<br>
It will zoom in the higher I go in levels<br>
Level, module, component, function, chunk. <br><br>
It will also show the percent done and what modules <br>
have been designed and which remain<br>
which modules have been completed noted by color<br>
and which modules have bugs still.<br>
